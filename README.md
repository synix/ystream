# Y/stream

A *unique* attempt to create a multi-master eventual consistent database that
syncs many CRDTs (e.g. Yjs documents) efficiently.

- network agnostic
- works everywhere (browser, node, ..)
- small footprint
- documents can have "capabilities" that can be synced with a filesystem.
- syncs __many__ documents efficiently
- Auth* integrated
- (experimental software)

This project is still in the early stages. I'm looking for a company that wants
to sponsor this work and integrate it in their product. Contact me
